# ProjectThree-CSC-210
They are interested in rearranging their produce section and need to know how often items are purchased so they can create the most effective layout for their customers. 

This project was to input information from the .txt file into the main.cpp file. With this information, we had to output the frequency of each product into the .dat file. From there, I have to output a specific outcome based on the user's input. 
The problem this project solved was allowing the user to access the number of products in the .txt file quickly and efficiently.
I did well in the aspect of creating a map to organize all of the information from the .txt file.
I feel as if I can enhance my code by making the decision factor into a switch-case. This could possibly make this more efficient. While preventing any infinite loops from happening.
The most challenging piece of code I had to write was the for loop for the map. To figure out this hump, I had to use stack overflow to find ways to loop through a map. This part took many hours of searching and testing to see what could work. :)
The skill of creating a map and looping through a .txt file are the skills I am taking away from this project. The ease of creating a map is amazing; the amount of time I could have used a map in the part is also amazing high. In addition, looping through a .txt file and gathering information will be extremely helpful as I work on bigger projects.
I made this program readable by adding an extreme amount of comments. I spent my time explaining almost every step as I created each line. I feel this will allow anyone who sees this project to understand every line of code created.
